<h1> Why Quadratic?</h1>
<p>
  Started with the idea of delivering transparent, honest and proactive consultation to achieve high returns on digital investments, we focus on partners and clients who are relatively new in their digital journeys or need support in building the optimum digital media mix.
</p>
<p>
Instead of focusing on traditional & volume based digital solutions we like to keep things very personal and targeted. Our clients prefer working with us because we understand their customers better than most of their employees do (yes, it is true!).
</p>
<p>
  In our first conversation, we conduct an audit that has a snippet of what your competitors are doing and how you are faring against those metrics. Depending on your goals - we then recommend a mix of strategies that are based on your key metrics (transactions, post likes, campaign reach, site visits, video views etc). In case you don't know what to measure - it is absolutely okay! We are here to help you identify all the signals that are crucial for your business. Once we have identified these metrics, we devise a plan and help you implement it by setting milestones. With dedicated support, you get to focus on your business, while we help you achieve your digital marketing goals.
</p>
<p>
  We are a bunch of young, crazy and committed individuals who believe in generating maximum value for all our partners. In this era of ever evolving technology, it is important to stay updated and that is why our entire team is certified by platforms like Google & Facebook.
